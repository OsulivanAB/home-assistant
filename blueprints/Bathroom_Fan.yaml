    # üöøüöΩ Bathroom Exhaust Fan

    ** Version 2.0 **


    I created this blueprint based on my experience with short-term rentals at my home.

    With short stays, you occasionally get tenants who might not be as mindful of upkeep‚Äîlikely because they‚Äôre unfamiliar with the space, right?

    With that in mind, I‚Äôve worked to make the setup as convenient and intuitive as possible, while still maintaining a sense of luxury.

    For instance, I've included a feature that triggers an action when the fan is turned on or off. I personally use it to control a [Pura diffuser](https://pura.com/), giving guests peace of mind and ensuring the space stays fresh for whoever comes next üöΩüí©.


    Huge thanks to [Blacky](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/blacky/summary) and his blueprints, which helped a lot in creating this blueprint.

      <summary><b>My The Automation Proccess:</b> üëà</summary>
      
      - **Triggers**
        - Humidity Rising:  `Humidity Derivative` > 0.25%/min
        - Humidity Stabalized:   -0.25%/min < `Humidity Derivative` < 0.25%/min
        - Humidity rises above threshold: `Humidity %` > ` Humidity Threshold`
        - Humidity falls below threshold: `Humidity %` < ` Humidity Threshold`
        - Fan switch turns on for `manual delay` minutes
        - Fan switch turns off  for `manual trigger off delay` seconds
        - Fan has been on for `safeguard time`


        üìù Note - Most triggers also must have been in their state for a set amoutn of time (such as `Trigger on delay`). This ensures things don't turn on and off rapidly.
      - **Conditions**
        - Any of the following conditions can be true:
          - Triggered by Humidity Rising
          - Triggered by Humidity % Above Max Humidity Threshold,
          - Triggered by Safeguard
          - Triggered by Humidity derivative stabalizing and humidity is below `Humidity Threshold`.
          - Triggered by Humidity % Falling below `Humidity threshold` and humidity derivative is stable
          - Triggered by fan switch being on for `manual delay` minutes, humidity is below `humidity threshold`, and `humidity derivative` is stable.
          - Triggered by fan switch turning off and one of the following:
            - `Humidity derivative` is still > 0.25%/min (still rising)
            - `Humidity derivative` is still < -0.25%/min (still helping)
            - `Humidity %` > `threshold` (still too humid)


      - **Automation**
        - When triggered by Humidity above threshold, humidity rising, or switch turned off, then turn on the `fan switch`, otherwise turn off the `fan switch`.

            This trigger will be used to determine if someone is showering or not, and will dynamically also tell us when to turn off the fan.


            Derivatives are a great way to determine if a sensor is increasing or decreasing.
            In this case, we are using it to determine if the humidity is increasing or decreasing more rapidly than it normally does.
            If the humidity derivative is increasing at a rate higher than it typically changes, we can assume someone is showering.
            If the himiddity derivative is decreasing at a rate higher than it typically changes, we can they're done.
            When it returns to a normal rate of change, we can assume the fan is no longer needed.

            The derivative sensor percentage must transition from below this value to above it to trigger the fan.

            When someone showers, the humidity rate of change (derivative) will go positive, when they finish it will go negative.
            In order for the fan to turn off, the humidity must be below the rising humidity threshold and above the falling humidity threshold.
            This indicates that the fan is done removing humidity from the air.

            The exception is for the manual switch triggers, which we'll do next.


            This is to prevent the fan from toggling rapidly when the values get close to the thresholds.
